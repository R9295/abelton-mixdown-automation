# Automate Mixdown initialization

A script that transfers all the VSTs on your MIDI tracks to a new track so you can freeze your MIDI tracks and then copies the VSTs back over for you <br/>

## Setup:

1. Copy paste the downloaded/cloned repository in your Remote Scripts folder.
2. Refer to the link to find out where the folder is for your OS:
https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/articles/206240184-Creating-your-own-Control-Surface-script

3. Select "ableton-mixdown-automation" in Preferences > Link/MIDI

4. Go to: 127.0.0.1:5010 or localhost:5010 and follow the instructions

## Note
It cannot freeze and flatten your tracks automatically as the Ableton API does not allow that.<br/>
The web interface sucks but does the job lol<br/>
**Errors**? **Wanna debug**? Check log.txt or see the code, it's very straightforward.
